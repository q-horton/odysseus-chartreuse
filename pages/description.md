# Project Description

This project is designed to be a dam controller which connects to an array of sensor nodes to determine pre-emptively when and by how much it should open its flood gates to both prevent flooding and minimise droughts. These sensor nodes would be situated in the surrounding area and contain both soil moisture and humidity sensors to track changes in moisture in the local environment. This data would then be transmitted through data muling methods from the sensor nodes to mobile 'mule' nodes when in range, which then transmits back to the controller's base node for storage and processing. The base node / dam controller would then make use of this data to operate dam gates to control the current water levels in the dam.
