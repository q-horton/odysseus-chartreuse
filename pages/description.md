# Project Description

This project involves developing a distributed, Zephyr-based embedded system for intelligent dam control. The system consists of low-power static sensor nodes deployed across the surrounding environment, each measuring soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels. A mobile 'mule' node fetches data opportunistically when within physical range of these sensor nodes, delivering it back to a central base node situated at the dam site when the mule returns from its circuit. Using this environmental data, the dam controller applies machine lerning and tuned control system aglorithms to dynamically determine the timing and extent by which to open the floodgates, stabiising the surrounding area to maximise flooding during heavy rainfall and maximise hydration during droughts.
